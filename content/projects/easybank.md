A simple and responsive landing page for a fictional digital banking company. I challenged myself not to use any external libraries such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to maximize the website performance.

Credits to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN) for the website design.
